# Chess - Minimax Algorithm (max-min search)

## Introduction

**Checker** is a chess-based game project where players compete against an AI opponent. The AI leverages the **Minimax algorithm** (max-min search) to predict and make optimal moves for the machine side. The algorithm aims to capture as many of the opponent's pieces as possible within the next 4 moves, creating a challenging gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Play against the AI**: The player competes with an AI opponent that strategizes its moves using the Minimax algorithm.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI calculates up to 4 moves ahead to maximize its capture of the opponentâ€™s pieces.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use controls and a straightforward interface for seamless gameplay.
